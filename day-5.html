  <h1>John's Ice Cream Shop</h1>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    John has an ice cream shop. He sells two kinds of ice cream: Chunky Chocolate and Creamy Pistachio. There is a line of customers waiting for the cashier to take their orders. Each customer will order one scoop of ice cream. The customers get in line at the back. When they get to the front, they get their ice cream and leave the line. Here is a picture of the line in front of his shop.John has an ice cream shop:

  <p>
    How many boys want pistachio and how many girls want chocolate?
  </p>

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>Boys, as we all know, don't have hair! So all we have to do is count the number of people without hair who are thinking about pistachio and count the people who do have hair(the two genders: hair and no hair, clearly) that are thinking about chocolate!</p>
  <p>Result: Two boys want pistachio and one girl wants chocolate.</p>

  <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
  <pre>
    FOR EACH PERSON in line
    IF: the person is bald and wants pistachio
    THEN: tally green (A)
    ELSE: don’t do anything
   
    FOR EACH PERSON in line
    IF: the person has hair and wants chocolate
    THEN: tally purple (B)
    ELSE: don’t do anything     

    Result: 2 green tallies, 1 purple tally
